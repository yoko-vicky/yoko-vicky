# Hi, I'm Yoko — a Frontend Developer Bridging Design Logic and Data Flow 👋

![cover-image](./images/bg-n.png)

🚀 I work with async-friendly, trust-based teams around the world — remote, hybrid, or on-site.
I focus on delivering accessible, maintainable, and intuitive interfaces — translating UX thinking into aligned frontend–backend flows.  
My work often involves defining API contracts from frontend needs, aligning logic with data shape, and reducing ambiguity between designers and backend engineers.

💡 My approach combines:

- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX-driven architecture and async-friendly component structure
- API contract definition and integration based on frontend logic
- Clear communication in distributed, trust-based teams

## 🌿 I believe in a structure that supports trust and autonomy.

Whether working independently or as part of a distributed team,  
I focus on clarifying requirements, sharing ideas early, and delivering code that respects users and teammates alike.

🔍 I’m currently deepening my accessibility practice — learning to design and build with inclusion from the start. I see accessibility not just as a checklist, but as a way to sharpen engineering, UX, and real-world care.

📖 I also write about what I learn:  
[How Accessibility Became a New Lens in My Work – and Why I'm Learning to See More Clearly ↗](https://medium.com/@yokoworks.dev/how-accessibility-became-a-new-lens-in-my-work-and-why-im-learning-to-see-more-clearly-5f7e2a6d5cc5)

✨ One of my recent articles — [From Universal Design to Personalized Interfaces ↗](https://medium.com/@yokoworks.dev/from-universal-design-to-personalized-interfaces-rethinking-accessibility-3f0d9b31150b) — was featured in [Bootcamp (UX Collective)](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc), a curated UX publication reaching 3M+ monthly readers.

🧠 Recently, I’ve been working on:

- Designing and implementing frontend architecture in async environments
- Aligning UI logic with backend structure and defining API contracts
- Building modular, maintainable UI components from Figma
- Translating design insights into testable, clear code with documentation

I’m especially passionate about clarifying logic across layers — from user flows to database design — to build products that feel simple, even when they aren’t.

Thanks for stopping by!  
If you're looking for a frontend developer who bridges design and engineering, let’s build something thoughtful together.
