# Hi there, I'm Yoko — a Frontend Developer Bridging Design, Data, and Code 👋

![cover-image](./images/center-bg-min.png)

🚀 Based in Georgia (UTC+4), I work with async-first, trust-based teams around the world. I focus on delivering clear, accessible interfaces through freelance projects, contract roles, and full-time collaborations. Also open to relocation with visa sponsorship to work closely with teams in their country.

I specialize in bridging design, data, and development — turning complex ideas into accessible, maintainable interfaces with clear, user-centered thinking, seamless API integration, and robust database access.

💡 My approach combines:

- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX-informed architecture and clear component design
- API integration planning and implementation
- Collaborative, async-friendly workflows for freelance, contract, or full-time projects

---

## 🌿 I believe in a structure that supports trust and autonomy.

Whether working independently or as part of a distributed team,  
I focus on clarifying requirements, sharing ideas early, and delivering code that respects users and teammates alike.

🧠 Recently, I’ve been working on:

- Designing and implementing frontend architecture in async environments
- Building maintainable, modular UI components from Figma
- Planning and implementing API integration with backend teams
- Translating design insights into testable code with clear documentation
