# Hi there, I'm Yoko â€” UX-focused Frontend Developer ðŸ‘‹

![cover-image](./images/github-bg2.png)

I bridge the gap between structure and interaction â€”  
bringing clarity to products and teams through thoughtful design and development.

ðŸ’¡ My background combines:
- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX strategy and structural design
- Cross-functional collaboration in async/global teams

---

## ðŸŒ¿ I think in flows and frameworks â€” not just features

Whether building a solo app or guiding team alignment,  
I focus on how structure supports user behavior, decision-making, and experience clarity.

ðŸ§  Recently Iâ€™ve been working on:
- UX tools to support async teams  
- Lightweight design systems for remote collaboration  
- Visualizing behavior and context through IA thinking
