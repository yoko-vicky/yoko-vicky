# Hi there, I'm Yoko — a UX-focused Frontend Developer 👋

![cover-image](./images/github-bg2.png)

🚀 Based in Georgia (UTC+4), I work with async-first, trust-based teams around the world. I focus on delivering clear, accessible interfaces through freelance projects, contract roles, and full-time collaborations. Also open to relocation with visa sponsorship to work closely with teams in their country.

I specialize in bridging design and development, turning complex ideas into accessible, maintainable interfaces through clear, user-centered thinking — including seamless API integration and database access when needed.

💡 My approach combines:
- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX-focused architecture and design
- Collaborative, async-friendly workflows across freelance, contract, or full-time projects

---

## 🌿 I believe in a structure that supports trust and autonomy.

Whether working independently or as part of a distributed team,  
I focus on clarifying requirements, sharing ideas early, and delivering code that respects users and teammates alike.

🧠 Recently, I’ve been working on:
- Designing and implementing frontend architecture in async environments
- Building lightweight design systems that balance consistency and flexibility
- Translating UX insights into modular, testable code with clear documentation, including API and database integration
