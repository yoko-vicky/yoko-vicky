# Hi there, I'm Yoko — a UX-Focused Frontend Developer who values Collaboration and Self-Direction 👋

![cover-image](./images/github-bg2.png)

🚀 Based in Georgia (UTC+4), I work with async-first, trust-based teams — blending independent problem-solving with open, respectful collaboration.

I specialize in bridging design and development, turning complex ideas into accessible, maintainable interfaces through clear, user-centered thinking.

💡 My approach combines:
- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX-focused architecture and structural design
- Collaborative, async-first workflows that value shared understanding over hierarchy

---

## 🌿 I believe in structure that supports trust and autonomy.

Whether working independently or as part of a distributed team,  
I focus on clarifying requirements, sharing ideas early, and delivering code that respects users and teammates alike.

🧠 Recently I’ve been working on:
- Designing and implementing frontend architecture in async environments
- Building lightweight design systems that balance consistency and flexibility
- Translating UX insights into modular, testable code with clear documentation
