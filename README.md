# Hi there, I'm Yoko — UX-focused Frontend Developer 👋

![cover-image](./images/github-bg2.png)

🚀 I'm currently open to remote opportunities (freelance or full-time) — especially roles that value UX-aware development and async collaboration.

I bridge the gap between structure and interaction —  
bringing clarity to products and teams through thoughtful design and development.

💡 My background combines:
- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX strategy and structural design
- Cross-functional collaboration in async/global teams

---

## 🌿 I think in flows and frameworks — not just features

Whether building a solo app or guiding team alignment,  
I focus on how structure supports user behavior, decision-making, and experience clarity.

🧠 Recently I’ve been working on:
- UX tools to support async teams  
- Lightweight design systems for remote collaboration  
- Visualizing behavior and context through IA thinking
