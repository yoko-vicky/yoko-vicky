# Hi there, I'm Yoko — Senior Frontend Engineer with a UX-Informed Approach 👋

![cover-image](./images/github-bg2.png)

🚀 Currently based in Georgia (UTC+4), working as a Senior Frontend Engineer with async-first remote teams — and open to relocation within Europe.

I specialize in bridging design intention and technical implementation — 
delivering scalable, maintainable, and accessible interfaces with a UX-informed approach.

💡 My background combines:
- Senior-level frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX-informed architecture and structural design
- Mentoring and cross-functional alignment in async/global teams

---

## 🌿 I think in flows and frameworks — not just features. As a senior engineer, I focus on how structure supports user behavior, decision-making, and experience clarity.

Whether working solo, collaborating with remote teams, or guiding alignment workshops,  
I focus on how structure supports user behavior, decision-making, and experience clarity.

🧠 Recently I’ve been working on:
- Leading frontend architecture planning for async teams  
- Building lightweight design systems for remote collaboration  
- Translating UX insights into maintainable, testable code
