# Hi there, I'm Yoko — a Frontend Developer Bridging Design, Data, and Code 👋

![cover-image](./images/center-bg-min.png)

🚀 Based in Georgia (UTC+4), I work with async-first, trust-based teams around the world. I focus on delivering clear, accessible interfaces through freelance projects, contract roles, and full-time collaborations. Also open to relocation with visa sponsorship to work closely with teams in their country.

I specialize in bridging design, data, and development — turning complex ideas into accessible, maintainable interfaces with clear, user-centered thinking, seamless API integration, and robust database access.  


💡 My approach combines:

- Frontend development (React / Next.js / TypeScript)
- UX-informed architecture and clear component design
- API integration planning and implementation
- Collaborative, async-friendly workflows for freelance, contract, or full-time projects

## 🌿 I believe in a structure that supports trust and autonomy.

Whether working independently or as part of a distributed team,  
I focus on clarifying requirements, sharing ideas early, and delivering code that respects users and teammates alike.

🔍 I’m currently deepening my accessibility practice — learning to design and build with inclusion from the start. I see accessibility not just as a checklist, but as a way to sharpen engineering, UX, and real-world care.

📖 I also write about what I learn:  
[How Accessibility Became a New Lens in My Work – and Why I'm Learning to See More Clearly ↗](https://medium.com/@yokoworks.dev/how-accessibility-became-a-new-lens-in-my-work-and-why-im-learning-to-see-more-clearly-5f7e2a6d5cc5)

✨ One of my recent articles — [From Universal Design to Personalized Interfaces ↗](https://medium.com/@yokoworks.dev/from-universal-design-to-personalized-interfaces-rethinking-accessibility-3f0d9b31150b) — was featured in [Bootcamp (UX Collective)](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc), a curated UX publication reaching 3M+ monthly readers.




🧠 Recently, I’ve been working on:

- Designing and implementing frontend architecture in async environments  
- Building maintainable, modular UI components from Figma  
- Planning and implementing API integration with backend teams  
- Translating design insights into testable code with clear documentation
